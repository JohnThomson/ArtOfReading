The Debian Package art-of-reading3
----------------------------------
The debian packaging (and bare Windows installer files) are available online
at https://github.com/sillsdev/ArtOfReading.  The images were retrieved from
the Windows installer downloaded from
https://s3.amazonaws.com/bloomlibrary.org/ArtOfReading/ArtOfReading-Free-Setup3.3.exe
I added the Makefile and the debian packaging.  Some reference was made to an
earlier package setup done by Daniel Glassey, but he bears no responsibility
for the content or format of this package.
